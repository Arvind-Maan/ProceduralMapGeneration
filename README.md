# PerlinNoiseMapGen
---
A procedurally generated map created by perlin noise using C# and Unity.


Generates a noise map using the built in Mathf.perlinnoise function in C#.
Noise Map:
![noisemap](images/noisemap.png)

Then applies colours and creates certain regions (a region can be a range of values, for example: region water range (0,.5))

Colour Map:

Future plans consist of adding mesh and creating a 3d plane, as opposed to a 2d one.
